# Data Science Project: Predicting Customer Churn

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my data science skills by understanding and predicting customer churn.

I have used a wide range of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning tools to analyze the patterns in customer churn behavior:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis. 
2. **SummaryTools:** Provided descriptive statistics and data profiling. 
3. **Missingo:** Helped identify and handle missing values.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Examined relationships between features.
5. **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor) Analysis:** Assessed multicollinearity.
6. **Ydata Profiling:** Conducted in-depth data exploration.

These EDA tools allowed me to understand the distribution of the data, identify missing values, and make informed decisions about data preprocessing.

## Machine Learning Models
After cleaning and preparing the data, I used the following machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn:

1. **Decision Trees:** Understood how the data can be split to make predictions.
2. **Logistic Regression:** Predicted churn and analyzed the statistical significance of features.

The machine learning models helped me identify the key drivers of customer churn and build predictive capabilities.
By combining EDA and machine learning techniques, I was able to gain insights into the customer churn problem and develop a robust model to predict future churn. This project showcases my ability to apply data science methodologies to real-world business challenges.
